# My fork of QGraphViz

This is my forked QGraphViz (https://github.com/ParisNeo/QGraphViz) with changes that got it to work for me locally.

I plan to make a small Graph Maker tool.

## Special thanks

All thanks to  [ParisNeo] https://github.com/ParisNeo for the whole project. I'm just hacking a couple bits. Other thanks can be found on this GitHub.
