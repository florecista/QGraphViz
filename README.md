# My fork of QGraphViz

This is my forked QGraphViz (https://github.com/ParisNeo/QGraphViz) with changes that got it to work for me locally.

I plan to make a small Graph Maker tool.

## Requirements

As its name suggests, this module needs you to install pyqt5 package first.

## Special thanks
